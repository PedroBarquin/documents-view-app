# About us

At **Holded**, we believe there is a different way to manage companies. An easier way. More effective. Better.

It all started in 2016. Our founders, Javi Fondevila and Bernat Ripoll created Holded with the vision of reinventing the concept of ERP.

Our mission is to consolidate our position as the leading cloud ERP in Spain, creating a smart business management solution that covers all areas of business. We replace manual processes with intuitive software to run and automate the business operations, covering Invoicing, Accounting, HR, CRM, and Projects & Inventory management.

We know that big goals need a great team. That’s why we’re looking for passionate people who work every day to be the best at what they do. Join our team of +120 employees and let’s reinvent how we do business!

From June 2021, Holded is part of the Visma group, one of Europe’s leading technology companies, with thousands of employees across 21 countries and over 4,000 developers.

At Holded, we do things differently. There’s no corporate nonsense, and no old-fashioned hierarchy. Instead, we work in self-sufficient, autonomous teams. Think of them like start-ups within a start-up that learn from each other.
We didn’t start Holded to be another software company. We started Holded to **be epic**, and you can be part of it!

# Our vision

Our mission in the Holded technology and product teams is to innovate and create software that helps organisations run
better while building a more sustainable future.

We use product and technology as the pillar to grow and make customers happy. We want to create the best platform to
help small businesses and accounting offices digitise and automate to boost productivity.

# About the Holded product

Holded is an affordable, easy-to-use cloud-based software platform designed especially for small business management. It
allows to manage every aspect of a business from a single place: invoicing, accounting, CRM, inventory, projects and
human resources. Watch
